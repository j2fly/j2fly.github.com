    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most anytime I develop a web application I need to deploy to multiple server environments. For me this used to mean maintaining two separate deploy.rb scripts, and I would rename one while deploying to staging, and then rename the other when I needed to deploy to production. After about three deploys I said, the hell with this! And I figured out how to allow the specification of your deployment at the command line during the cap deploy task.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, why not create your own cap task that is called cap deploy_production and cap deploy_staging (or whatever), but I didn&rsquo;t want to muck around with that. Here is how I get Capistrano to prompt ME!</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">default_run_options[:pty] = true
ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true
# also had to set up id_ras keys for the deploy user on the production box (to itself). And setup the tunnel definition as well in ~/.subversion/config
# Local =&gt; rs_ssh = /opt/local/bin/ssh -p 2384 -l jkinney
# Production =&gt; rs_ssh = /usr/bin/ssh -p 2384 -l jkinney

set :gems_for_project, %w(highline,will_paginate,etc...) # list of gems to be installed

# Make terminal prompt us for the location we want to deploy to
set :deploy_location, Proc.new { deploy_location = Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask "Enter deploy location (stage/prod)" }

if "#{deploy_location}" == "prod"
  set :domain, "209.41.75.42"
else
  # I have ssh setup on a non-standard port for my staging box, since it's exposed to the world. Our production box required VPN or local netowrk access.
  ssh_options[:port] = 2384
  set :domain, "YOUR STAGING IP HERE"
  # note that your staging could be on the same server, just setup your application names differently then so you aren't overwriting things.
end

# prompts for a release tag, if that is your sort of thing...
set :release_tag, Proc.new { release_tag = Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask "Enter a release tag to deploy (type trunk or leave blank and hit enter to deploy from trunk)" }

role :app, domain
role :web, domain
role :db,  domain, :primary =&gt; true

set :application, "jonkinneydotcom"

set :user, "deploy"
set :password, "secret"

set :rails_env, "production"

# I thought this was automatic, but I seem to need to require it to cleanup my releases
set :keep_releases, 4

# this is using subversion, I am transitioning to GIT and will post updates when I have a modified deploy.rb
set :repo_location, "/var/svn/your_subversion_repo"
set :repository, "svn+ssh://#{domain}#{repo_location}/#{application}/trunk"

namespace :deploy do
  desc "restart passenger"

    # OPTIONAL: symlink files from the FTP site's home directory to the rails_root 
    # keep them protected and use send_file to present them to the logged in user 
    # (this is more secure than hiding them in a public directory with directory listing off)
    # run "rm -rf #{release_path}/admin_files" 
    # run "ln -s #{deploy_to}/#{shared_dir}/admin_files #{release_path}"

######################Custom cap tasks that I find useful
desc "Configure VHost"
task :config_vhost do
  vhost_config =&lt;&lt;-EOF

<p>Hopefully this has been helpful. I know Capistrano can be somewhat of a black box for people, so if you have issues with my deploy.rb or need any help feel free to contact me or post in the comments!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am running a VPS over at <a href="http://silverrack.com">SilverRack.com</a> and I love it. Dave (the owner) has been very helpful and responsive anytime I&rsquo;ve had questions or issues, and I highly recommend their service. Also if you&rsquo;re a member of a local Ruby user group then you can get $10 off the standard 256mb slice making it extremely affordable to have your very own server! I also have an unlimited Dreamhost account, but I like having root access and full reign of my server.</p>

<h3>Enable the cron.log for Ubuntu</h3>

<p>By default, Ubuntu disables the cron log, so you need to turn it on, and additionally create the log file before you can start tailing that log.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Use these steps to get your log on:</p>

<p>Create the cron.log file
<code>bash
touch /var/log/cron.log
</code></p>

<p>Edit /etc/syslog.conf and uncomment the line starting with <code>cron.*</code>
<code>bash
vim /etc/syslog.conf
</code></p>

<p>Restart sysklogd</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ /etc/init.d/sysklogd restart
</code></pre>

<p>Restart cron</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ /etc/init.d/cron restart
</code></pre>

<p>Then to watch your cron jobs execute this command:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ tail -f /var/log/cron.log
</code></pre>
