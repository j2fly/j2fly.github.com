I'm excited to announce that after a few years in the startup game, I'll be returning to consulting full time! Starting August 1st I'll be the Chief Architect at [FasterAgile](http://fasteragile.com) where I'll be reunited with my friend and former colleague Pete Jackson to build amazing software for our clients. Pete and I previously worked together at another consultancy and I'm thrilled to make good on my LinkedIn endorsement's sentiment of "I'd welcome the opportunity to work with Pete again."

If you or someone you know needs top notch Ruby on Rails or Ember.js talent, [let me know](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=jondkinney&text=I%20need%20some%20help%20with%20Ruby%20on%20Rails%20%2F%20Ember.js!)!
